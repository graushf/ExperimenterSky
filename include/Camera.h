/*
*	This camera system is an FPS-like camera that suits most purposes and works well with Euler Angles,
*	but be careful when creating different camera systems like a flight simulatin camera. Each camera
*	system has its own tricks and quirks so be sure to read up on them. For example, this FPS camera 
*	doesn't allow for pitch values higher than 90 degrees and a static up vector of (0, 1, 0) doesn't 
*	work when we take roll values into account.
